2. **Profile Completion**: You need to complete your profile by adding your full name and phone number

1. Check your spam/junk folder

## Browsing and Searching Cars

### How do I view available cars?

Once you're logged in and have completed your profile:

1. Go to the **"Browse Cars"** section from the main menu
2. You'll see all vehicles displayed in a card format
3. Each car shows:
   - Model and license plate
   - Year, color, and seating capacity
   - Current availability status
   - Description (if available)

### How do I search for specific cars?

The system provides several search options:

1. **Search Bar**: Type car model, license plate, or description keywords
2. **Filter Options**: Filter by seats, color, or other characteristics
3. **Status Filter**: View only available, maintenance, or out-of-service cars

### How do I check if a car is available for specific dates?

Car availability is checked when you create a reservation:

1. Select the car you want to reserve
2. Choose your desired dates and times
3. The system automatically checks availability
4. If the car is already booked during your requested time, it won't appear in the available cars list

### What do the different car statuses mean?

Car statuses indicate availability:

- **Available**: Can be reserved for bookings
- **Maintenance**: Temporarily unavailable for reservations
- **Out of Service**: Permanently unavailable

Only cars with "Available" status can be reserved.

### How do I get more information about a specific car?

Each car card shows:

- **Basic Info**: Model, license plate, year, color
- **Capacity**: Number of seats
- **Status**: Current availability
- **Description**: Additional details about the car

If you need more information, contact your administrator.

## Making Reservations

### How do I make a car reservation?

To create a new reservation:

1. Go to the **"My Reservations"** section or click **"New Reservation"** from the dashboard
2. Fill out the reservation form:
   - **Start Date & Time**: When you need the car
   - **End Date & Time**: When you'll return the car
   - **Car Selection**: Choose from available cars for your dates
   - **Driver Name**: (Optional) Who will be driving
   - **Comments**: (Optional) Any additional notes
3. Click **"Submit Reservation"**

### Why do I need to request a reservation instead of instantly booking?

Your organization may use an approval process to ensure proper fleet management and prevent conflicts. When you submit a reservation request, it goes to administrators for review. This allows them to:

- Verify car availability
- Check for scheduling conflicts
- Ensure the reservation aligns with company policies
- Manage the fleet effectively

Some organizations may enable automatic approval, but manual approval is more common.

### How long does it take for reservations to be approved?

Reservation approval times vary depending on your organization's policies and administrator availability. Generally:

- **Typical Response**: 1-2 business days
- **Peak Times**: May take longer during busy periods
- **Urgent Requests**: Contact your administrator directly

Unfortunately, the system doesn't send email notifications, so you'll need to check your reservation status manually.

### Can I modify or cancel my reservation?

**Modifying Reservations**: Once submitted, reservations cannot be modified directly. You'll need to:

1. Cancel the existing reservation
2. Create a new reservation with the correct details

**Cancelling Reservations**: Depending on your organization's policies:

- **Automatic Cancellation**: Some organizations allow direct cancellation
- **Approval Required**: Others require administrator approval for cancellations
- **Time Limits**: There may be minimum notice requirements

### What information do I need to provide for a reservation?

Required information:

- **Start Date & Time**: When you need the car
- **End Date & Time**: When you'll return the car
- **Car Selection**: Choose from available vehicles

Optional information:

- **Driver Name**: If someone else will be driving
- **Comments**: Any special requests or notes

### How do I select a car for my reservation?

When creating a reservation:

1. Choose your dates and times first
2. The system will show only cars available during your selected period
3. Select from the dropdown list of available cars
4. Each option shows the car model, license plate, and other details

### What are the reservation time limits?

Your organization may have policies regarding:

- **Advance Booking**: How far in advance you can book
- **Maximum Duration**: How long you can keep a car
- **Business Hours**: When cars can be picked up and returned
- **Weekend Availability**: Whether weekend reservations are allowed

These limits are set by your administrator and may vary by organization.

## Managing Your Reservations

To see all your reservations:

1. Go to **"My Reservations"** from the main menu

Depending on your organization's policies:

- **Immediate Cancellation**: Some organizations allow direct cancellation

## Understanding System Behavior

### Why doesn't the system send email notifications?

The system does not send email notifications for reservation status changes due to Firebase free tier limitations and lack of access to Cloud Functions. Only basic Firebase authentication emails are sent:

- **Email verification** when you register
- **Password reset** when you request it

You must manually check your reservation status by logging into the system.

### How often should I check my reservation status?

Since there are no email notifications, you should check regularly:

- **Daily**: If you have pending reservations
- **Weekly**: For general reservation management
- **Before Your Reservation**: Always check status before your scheduled time

### What are the system's limitations?

The system has several limitations due to being built on Firebase's free tier:

- **No email notifications** for reservation changes
- **No real-time updates** (must refresh to see changes)
- **Limited concurrent users** (performance may slow with many users)
- **No image uploads** for cars or profiles
- **Basic search functionality**

### Why does the system sometimes seem slow?

Performance can be affected by:

- **Firebase daily limits**: If exceeded, service may become temporarily unavailable
- **Internet connection**: Slow or unstable connections
- **Multiple users**: High usage during peak times
- **Large amounts of data**: Many reservations or cars in the system

### What should I do if I can't access the system?

If you can't log in or access features:

1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Try a different browser** or clear your browser cache
3. **Verify your account status** isn't suspended
4. **Ensure your profile is complete** and email is verified
5. **Contact your administrator** if problems persist

### How does the system handle conflicting reservations?

The system prevents conflicts by:

- **Availability checking**: Only showing available cars for your selected dates
- **Preventing overlaps**: Cars already booked won't appear in your options
- **Administrative review**: Admins can catch and resolve any conflicts

However, there's no real-time conflict resolution, so always check availability when making reservations.
