## Getting Started

### How do I log into the system?

To access the car reservation system, your email needs to have been added to the system by an administrator and you need to register an account. Once your account is created, you can log in using your email address and password.

### Why can't I access the system after logging in?

The system requires several steps to be completed before you can access all features. First, you must verify your email address by clicking the link sent to your email. Second, you need to complete your profile by adding your full name and phone number. Finally, your account must not be suspended. If you're having trouble with any of these steps, contact your administrator for assistance.

### How do I verify my email address?

When you first register or if your email isn't verified, you'll receive an email with a verification link. Click this link to verify your email address. If you don't see the email, check your spam folder. You can also request a new verification email from your profile page by clicking the "Resend Verification Email" button.

### How do I complete my profile?

After email verification, you'll be prompted to complete your profile by adding your full name and phone number. This information is required for the reservation system to function properly. You can also access your profile at any time by clicking on your name in the top right corner of the screen.

## Browsing and Searching Cars

### How do I view available cars?

Once you're logged in and have completed your profile, you can browse the fleet by navigating to the main cars page. Here you'll see all vehicles that are currently available for reservation. Each car listing shows important details like the model, capacity, color, and current availability status.

### How do I search for specific cars?

The system provides several ways to find the right car for your needs. You can use the search bar to look for specific models or use the filtering options to narrow down cars by capacity, color, or other characteristics.

### How do I check if a car is available for specific dates?

When creating a reservation, you'll be able to select the dates and times you need. The system will automatically check the availability of the car for those dates. If the car is already reserved during your requested time, it will not appear in the list of available cars.

## Making Reservations

### How do I make a car reservation?

From the reservations page or the main page click on New Reservation. You'll be prompted to select a car, choose the start and end dates, and provide any additional details required by your organization. After filling out the form, submit your reservation request.

### Why do I need to request a reservation instead of instantly booking?

It depends on the system settings. Administrators could choose to use an approval process to ensure proper management of the fleet and to prevent conflicts. When you submit a reservation request, it goes to the administrators for review. This allows them to verify availability, check for any conflicts, and ensure the reservation aligns with company policies. Administrator may enable automatic reservations, but this is less common in organizational settings.

### How long does it take for reservations to be approved?

Reservation approval times can vary depending on your organization's policies and the administrator's availability. Generally, reservations are reviewed within one to two business days. You'll receive an email notification when your reservation is approved, rejected, or if the administrator needs additional information.

### Can I modify or cancel my reservation?

Depending on the system policies you may be able to automatically cancel your reservation or submit a cancellation request. Reservation cannot be modified once submitted, but you can cancel it and create a new one if your plans change. If you need to cancel a reservation, go to your reservation history, find the reservation you want to cancel, and follow the cancellation process. If you have any issues, contact your administrator for assistance.

## Managing Your Account

### How do I update my profile information?

You can update your profile information by clicking on your name in the top right corner and selecting "Profile" from the dropdown menu. From your profile page, you can edit your name, phone number, and other personal information. Keep in mind that some information like your email address may require administrator approval to change.

### How do I change my password?

To change your password, go to your profile page and look for the "Change Password" option. You'll need to enter your current password and then your new password twice to confirm. Choose a strong password that includes a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters for better security.

### What should I do if I forget my password?

If you forget your password, use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page. Enter your email address and you'll receive instructions on how to reset your password. Follow the link in the email to create a new password for your account.

### How do I change my language preferences?

The system may support multiple languages depending on your organization's configuration. You can change your language from the app heade. Look for a language selection option, and choose your preferred language. The interface will update to reflect your choice. This choice will be remembered for future logins.

## Reservation History and Status

### How do I view my reservation history?

You can view all your past, current, and upcoming reservations from your profile page or from a dedicated "My Reservations" section. This history shows you the details of each reservation including the car used, dates, times, and the status of each reservation.

### What do the different reservation statuses mean?

Reservations can have several statuses. "Pending" means your request is waiting for administrator approval. "Approved" means your reservation has been confirmed and the car is reserved for you. "Cancellation Pending" means that you have submitted a cancelation request and is waiting for administrator approval. "Cancelled" means the reservation has been cancelled either by you or the administrator.

### How do I know if my reservation was approved?

You can check your reservation history at any time to see the current status of all your reservations. The system will clearly indicate whether each reservation is pending, approved, rejected, or cancelled.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Why am I seeing a "Profile Incomplete" or "Verify Email" message?

"Profile Incomplete" when you haven't completed all required profile information. "Verify Email" message appears when you have not validated your email address by clicing the link sent to your email. Make sure you've verified your email address and added your full name and phone number. Until these steps are completed, you won't be able to access the full reservation system. These measures ensure a secure system for everyone.

### Why can't I make a reservation?

There are several reasons why you might not be able to make a reservation. Your profile might be incomplete, your account might be suspended, or there might not be any available cars for your requested dates. Check your profile completeness and contact your administrator if you continue to have issues.

### The system seems slow or unresponsive. What should I do?

System performance can be affected by internet connection issues or high usage periods. Try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache. If the problem persists, try using a different browser or device. Contact your administrator if the system continues to be slow or unresponsive.

### I'm not receiving email notifications. How can I fix this?

First, check your spam or junk mail folder, as system emails sometimes end up there. Make sure your email address is correct in your profile. You can also ask your administrator to verify that email notifications are enabled for your account. If you use email filters, make sure they're not blocking system emails.

## Best Practices and Tips

### How far in advance should I make reservations?

The optimal advance booking time depends on your organization's policies and demand for vehicles. Generally, booking at least a few days in advance gives administrators time to review and approve your request. For popular times or special events, consider booking even further in advance.

### What should I do if I need to use the car differently than originally planned?

If your plans change after your reservation is approved, contact the administrator as soon as possible to discuss modifications. Being proactive about changes helps maintain good relationships with the administrative team and ensures the fleet is managed effectively.

### How can I make the reservation process smoother?

Keep your profile information up to date, plan your reservations in advance, and provide detailed information about your needs when making requests. Understanding your organization's policies and peak usage times can also help you plan more effectively and avoid potential conflicts.
